                        EXCEL CLEANER - USER GUIDE
================================================================================

WHAT DOES THIS TOOL DO?
------------------------
This tool automatically removes unwanted rows from your Excel files based on
specific patterns. It's designed for cleaning purchase order data but can be
used for any Excel file with the required columns.


HOW TO USE IT
-------------

METHOD 1: DRAG AND DROP (Easiest!)
  1. Find your Excel file (.xlsx)
  2. Drag it onto ExcelCleaner.exe
  3. Wait a moment
  4. A message will appear showing the results
  5. Your cleaned file will be in the same folder as the original
     (named: YourFile_CLEANED.xlsx)

METHOD 2: FILE PICKER
  1. Double-click ExcelCleaner.exe
  2. A window will open asking you to select a file
  3. Browse to your Excel file and click Open
  4. Wait a moment
  5. A message will appear showing the results
  6. Your cleaned file will be in the same folder


WHAT GETS REMOVED?
------------------
The tool looks at 4 specific columns in your Excel file and removes entire
rows if they contain certain words or patterns:

Column BV (ShipmentID):
  ❌ Removes rows containing "FOC"
  
Column H (Order):
  ❌ Removes rows containing:
     - "test" or "testing"
     - "M88" (including M880123, M88-abc, etc.)
     - "GB Test", "GB Testing", or just "GB"
  
Column I (Buyer PO Number):
  ❌ Removes rows containing:
     - "test" or "testing"
     - "FOC"
  
Column BO (Comment):
  ❌ Removes rows containing:
     - "FOC"
     - "M88"

IMPORTANT NOTES:
  • Matching is NOT case-sensitive (FOC = foc = FoC)
  • Partial matches count (M880123 matches M88)
  • Your original file is NEVER changed
  • A new file is created with "_CLEANED" added to the name


EXAMPLE
-------
Original file: PurchaseOrders.xlsx
Cleaned file:  PurchaseOrders_CLEANED.xlsx

If your original file has 1000 rows and 50 match the removal patterns,
your cleaned file will have 950 rows.


WHAT YOU'LL SEE
---------------
After processing, a message box will show:

  ✓ Cleaning completed successfully!
  
  Original rows: 1000
  Rows removed: 50
  Remaining rows: 950
  
  Cleaned file saved to:
  C:\Users\YourName\Documents\PurchaseOrders_CLEANED.xlsx

------------
✓ Your Excel file must be .xlsx format (not .xls)
